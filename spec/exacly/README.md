# Exacly's own model

Exacly models itself, following the layout in section 13 of the specification. It is the first model whose state will come from real observations.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Namespace | `exacly` |
| Owner | `exacly-maintainers` |
| Specification | [0.2.0](exacly-0.2.0.md), an unmodified copy of [`../versions/0.2.0.md`](../versions/0.2.0.md) |
| Boundary | [`model.yaml`](model.yaml) |
| Extensions | None |

## Config

- [`validation.yaml`](validation.yaml) covers checking a model. The validator, CI and the repository exist today, so these records are active.
- [`observation.yaml`](observation.yaml) covers observing a model's reality: `exacly-refresh` and the CI job that runs it on main are active, and the measure they feed is proposed.

## State

[`state/main.json`](state/) is the state for main, written only by `exacly-refresh` and committed only from main by CI. On each push to main, the workflow's `state` job reruns the checks, refreshes the state from the test results, validates it with the config, and commits it with `[skip ci]`. It doesn't commit if a check fails or main has moved on.

`mise run check` runs the same refresh locally and on pull requests, writing to `reports/state/main.json` without committing anything. A proposed change can show its effect on state this way, but never stores it. Validation in CI reads that fresh state rather than the committed one, so a change that removes a record isn't blocked by state from before it.

`--distribution` says that main is how Exacly is distributed, since people install it from the repository. So an implementer present at the revision counts as released there.

## Bindings

A `tests` binding tells refresh which results verify a record:

```yaml
observe:
  tests:
    workflow: .github/workflows/spec.yml   # the workflow that runs the tests
    cases:                                 # optional: glob patterns over case IDs
      - "validator/tests/*/cases.yaml::7.*"
```

A case ID is `<cases file>::<description>` for a data-driven case, and `<test file>::<test name>` for any other test. Patterns are case-sensitive. Without `cases`, the job's own result is the evidence. Each test reports its case ID in the JUnit report, as the `exacly-case` property.

## Validating

```sh
mise run model
```

This runs the tests, refreshes state into `reports/state/main.json`, and validates the config with that state for the current commit. CI runs it on every change as part of `mise run check`. A binding may also name a `job`; Exacly's don't, because the checks run in both the `check` and `state` jobs.
